# js13k Webpack Starter
We use these:
 - (Kontra.js) https://straker.github.io/kontra/getting-started
 - (webpack) https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started
 - (esbuild) https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started

## Start working on the project
Make sure to run the watch command to compile the code everytime you make a change:
```
npn run watch
```
Then you can just run dist/index.html in your web browser

## When you are done
You can run:
```
npm run build
```

Then just pack the dist folder with your favorite zip program
